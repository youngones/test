This is a Test repository for a beginner. 
Github has an excellent 'Github hello-world guide for dummys'. 
Thank you Github.

This line only: This is a message added on the github website. We'll see how I can merge this file with the local repository change when I 'push' it. 

This line as well: Edited on the web (master branch). What will happend when the local repository is pushed?
